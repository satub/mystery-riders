Webapp CRUD to rate & comment on NYC subway lines

To play around with this code, clone the repository, run shotgun in the project directory:

$ shotgun -p 1234

 and navigate to localhost:1234 with your favorite browser.

 If you'd like to start with a completely empty database (except for the subway lines), delete files development.sqlite and schema.rb from the db directory and then run rake db:migrate in the project root directory.
